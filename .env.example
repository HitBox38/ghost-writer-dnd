# D&D Flavor Text Generator - Environment Variables

# Note: This application uses client-side API keys stored in localStorage.
# No server-side environment variables are required for basic functionality.

# If you want to pre-configure API keys for development/testing:
# (These are NOT used by the application - API keys are managed in the Settings UI)

# NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# NEXT_PUBLIC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY=...

# The application is designed to be fully client-side with BYOK (Bring Your Own Key).
# Users configure their API keys through the Settings dialog in the application.
